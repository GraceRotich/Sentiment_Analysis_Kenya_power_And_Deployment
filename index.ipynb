    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "KPLC needs an automated sentiment analysis system to process and categorize customer feedback from social media, particularly X formerly (Twitter) where customers frequently express their sentiments regarding KPLC's services. By accurately classifying tweets related to KPLC’s services into sentiment categories the system will be able to identify issues by pinpointing common complaints and service issues and enhance customer feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* To gauge overall customer sentiment towards KPLC's services.·   \n",
    "\n",
    "* To Identify specific issues mentioned in the tweets, such as token problems, power outages, billing issues, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To Create a chatbot that provides appropriate responses to customer inquiries\n"

    "### Challenges\n",
    "1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:\n",
    "Gathering relevant tweets mentioning KPLC, especially when customers use various hashtags, misspellings or slang, can be difficult. Additionally, cleaning and preprocessing the data (e.g., removing noise like unrelated tweets, abbreviations) is crucial but time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sentiment Analysis Accuracy:\n",
    "Accurately classifying the sentiment of tweets can be challenging due to the informal language, sarcasm, mixed sentiments and local dialects often used on X/Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identifying Specific Issues:\n",
    "Extracting and categorizing specific issues (e.g power outages, billing issues) mentioned in tweets can be complex due to the diverse ways in which customers describe their problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real-time Data Processing:\n",
    "Processing a continuous stream of tweets in real-time to provide timely insights and responses is demanding in terms of computational resources and model efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handling Multilingual and Local Dialects:\n",
    "Tweets may be in multiple languages or include local dialects, which can complicate sentiment analysis and issue detection. \n",
    "6. Evaluating Model Performance:\n",
    "Ensuring the models perform well across different contexts, languages, and over time requires ongoing evaluation and tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and APIs (e.g., Twitter API) to collect and preprocess tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement data cleaning scripts to filter out irrelevant data and normalize the text for consistent analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train sentiment analysis models using machine learning techniques such as supervised learning with labeled datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a robust pipeline using tools for real-time data streaming and processing. Integrate with scalable cloud services such as AWS or Google Cloud to ensure the system can handle large volumes of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Utilize existing chatbot frameworks like Rasa, integrated with the sentiment analysis and issue categorization models. This chatbot should be able to provide relevant responses based on the sentiment and identified issues and direct users to appropriate resources or support channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incorporate multilingual NLP models and fine-tune them with local dialect data. Using translation APIs where necessary to standardize inputs before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up a continuous evaluation framework using A/B testing, cross-validation and performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score and precision/recall. Regularly retrain models with new data to adapt to evolving customer language and sentiment.\n"
